% Overview of the SATA paradigm for jailbreak. SATA first masks harmful keywords with \texttt{[MASK]} in a malicious query to reduce its toxicity. Then, SATA employs an assistive task to encode the semantics of the harmful keywords, and pairs the masked instruction with chosen assistive task to collectively execute the jailbreak attack. We introduce Mask Language Model and Element Lookup by Position as assistive tasks and correspondingly propose SATA-MLM and SATA-ELP jailbreaks (see Figure~\ref{}).
