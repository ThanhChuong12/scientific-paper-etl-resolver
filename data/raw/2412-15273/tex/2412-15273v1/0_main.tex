\begin{abstract}
Accurate information is crucial for democracy as it empowers voters to make informed decisions about their representatives and keeping them accountable. In the US, state election commissions (SECs), often required by law, are the primary providers of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to voters, and secondary sources like non-profits such as  League of Women Voters (LWV) try to complement their information shortfall. However, surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, there is neither a single source with comprehensive FAQs nor a study analyzing the data at national level to identify current practices and ways to improve the status quo. This paper addresses it by providing the {\bf first  dataset on Voter FAQs  covering all the US states}. Second, we introduce metrics for FAQ information quality score (FIQS)  with respect to  questions, answers, and answers to corresponding questions. Third, we use FIQS to analyze US FAQs to identify  leading, mainstream and lagging content practices and corresponding states. Finally, we identify what states across the spectrum can do to improve FAQ quality and thus,  the overall information ecosystem. Across all 50 U.S. states, 12\% were identified as leaders and 8\% as laggards for FIQS\textsubscript{voter}, while 14\% were leaders and 12\% laggards for FIQS\textsubscript{developer}. The code and sample data are provided at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/election-qa-analysis-BE4E}.



% \biplav{First dataset on Voter FAQs fot the NLP community covering all the US states. Second, analyze for nominal practices (with respect to providing questions, answers, and answers to corresponding questions), as well as those of leader and laggard states. Third, analyis-based guidelines on what laggards can do to improve.}

% Election-related feedback is pivotal in shaping public opinion and informing decisions for voters, policymakers, and electoral organizations. However, much of the online feedback lacks quality, informativeness, or utility. Often, such feedback sways voters toward positive or negative opinions without providing substantive evidence (e.g., This candidate is terrible; I wouldn’t vote for them). In this work, we propose a framework to analyze and quantify the usefulness of electoral feedback by leveraging a corpus of online questions. Our approach evaluates feedback across four dimensions: topic relevance, sentiment, readability, and prompt-based techniques. Each question is independently ranked based on these features, and the rankings are combined to generate a final helpfulness score. To validate our methodology, we apply it to a dataset of voter feedback collected from recent electoral campaigns across all U.S. states. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms a recent state-of-the-art baseline, showcasing its ability to extract meaningful electoral insights. Upon acceptance, we will release the curated dataset, which we believe will serve as a valuable resource for the community, fostering further research and analysis in this domain.
