We declare that all authors of this paper acknowledge the {\em ACM Code of Ethics} and honor the code of
conduct. This work collates and  evaluates {\bf open data} related to voters from SECs and the non-profit, LWV. By definition and spirit of open data, the data providers intended to make their data reusable and consumable, and we process it acknowledging full credits to providers. {\em (After anonymous review period, we will elaborate on our continued engagement with them.)} Our findings on content  is intended to help stakeholders understand best practices and help improve the overall voter information ecosystem. We believe our work will help the NLP community leverage its state-of-the-art methods to positively improve governance, an important aspect of society.
