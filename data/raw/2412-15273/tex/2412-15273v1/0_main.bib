abstract = {Chatbots, or bots for short, are multimodal collaborative assistants that can help people complete useful tasks. Usually, when chatbots are referenced in connection with elections, they often draw negative reactions due to the fear of mis‐information and hacking. Instead, in this work, we explore how chatbots may be used to promote voter participation in vulnerable segments of society like senior citizens and first‐time voters. In particular, we have built a system that amplifies official information while personalizing it to users' unique needs transparently (e.g., language, cognitive abilities, linguistic abilities). The uniqueness of this work are (a) a safe design where only responses that are grounded and traceable to an allowed source (e.g., official question/answer) will be answered via system's self‐awareness (metacognition), (b) a do‐not‐respond strategy that can handle customizable responses/deflection, and (c) a low‐programming design‐pattern based on the open‐source Rasa platform to generate chatbots quickly for any region. Our current prototypes use frequently asked questions (FAQ) election information for two US states that are low on an ease‐of‐voting scale, and have performed initial evaluations using focus groups with senior citizens. Our approach can be a win‐win for voters, election agencies trying to fulfill their mandate and democracy at&nbsp;large.},

  abstract={According to the burgeoning voter mobilization field experiments literature, impersonal contact has little-to-no effect. A conversation with a computer is, by definition, an impersonal interaction. However, chatbots are form of communication wherein a computer imitates conversations by interacting using natural language. Human-to-chatbot interactions are often perceived as similar to human-to-human interactions. How ubiquitous are chatbots? Just ask Siri, Cortana, Bixby, or Alexa, or ask for help on any e-commerce website (these are each chatbots). A simple voter mobilization treatment reminding users of a political chatbot (Resistbot) to vote and providing information about polling locations and hours increased turnout by 1.8 percentage points in a 2019 election. The results replicate previously unpublished field experiments by Resistbot in 2018 that found smaller but statistically significant increases in turnout.},

Our framework is both theory and data-driven, and utilizes domain expertise. Our simulation effort helps understanding how information flows and evolves in social media platforms. We focused on modeling three information domains: cryptocurrencies, cyber threats, and software vulnerabilities for the three interrelated social environments: GitHub, Reddit, and Twitter. We participated in the SocialSim DARPA Challenge in December 2018, in which our models were subjected to an extensive performance evaluation for accuracy, generalizability, explainability, and experimental power. This paper reports the main concepts and models, utilized in our social media modeling effort in developing a multi-resolution simulation at the user, community, population, and content levels.",

We study the behavior of retweet bots on Twitter during the first impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump. We collect over 67.7 million impeachment related tweets from 3.6 million users, along with their 53.6 million edge follower network. We find although bots represent 1% of all users, they generate over 31% of all impeachment related tweets. We also find bots share more disinformation, but use less toxic language than other users. Among supporters of the Qanon conspiracy theory, a popular disinformation campaign, bots have a prevalence near 10%. The follower network of Qanon supporters exhibits a hierarchical structure, with bots acting as central hubs surrounded by isolated humans. We quantify bot impact using the generalized harmonic influence centrality measure. We find there are a greater number of pro-Trump bots, but on a per bot basis, anti-Trump and pro-Trump bots have similar impact, while Qanon bots have less impact. This lower impact is due to the homophily of the Qanon follower network, suggesting this disinformation is spread mostly within online echo-chambers.},

We have developed, to the best of our knowledge, the first-ever numeric PDDL tailored for opinion dynamics. Our tool empowers users to visualize intricate networks, simulate the evolution of opinions, and strategically influence that evolution to achieve specific outcomes. By harnessing Automated Planning techniques, our framework offers a nuanced approach to devise sequences of actions tailored to transition a network from its current opinion landscape to a desired state. This holistic approach provides insights into the intricate interplay of individual nodes within a network and paves the way for targeted interventions.

abstract = {Manipulation is a concern in many domains, such as social media, advertising, and chatbots. As AI systems mediate more of our digital interactions, it is important to understand the degree to which AI systems might manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Our work clarifies challenges in defining and measuring this kind of manipulation from AI systems. Firstly, we build upon prior literature on manipulation and characterize the space of possible notions of manipulation, which we find to depend upon the concepts of incentives, intent, covertness, and harm. We review proposals on how to operationalize each concept and we outline challenges in including each concept in a definition of manipulation. Second, we discuss the connections between manipulation and related concepts, such as deception and coercion. We then analyze how our characterization of manipulation applies to recommender systems and language models, and give a brief overview of the regulation of manipulation in other domains. While some progress has been made in defining and measuring manipulation from AI systems, many gaps remain. In the absence of a consensus definition and reliable tools for measurement, we cannot rule out the possibility that AI systems learn to manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Manipulation could pose a significant threat to human autonomy and precautionary actions to mitigate it are likely warranted.},
