\section{Limitations}

%\vipula{to be written by Dr. Biplav}

Our work has a few limitations.
We have used open data of the 50 states as-is and relied on the unique position of SECs to provide authentic information about those states. Further, we have only used data from one non-profit, LWV, but it covers all the US states. The limitations can be easily overcome on number of sources can be overcome by adding more providers seamlessly. 
We have used state-of-the-art NLP methods as implemented in off-the-shelf tools; however, nothing precludes us from using new methods in future.
