\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented a simple but effective post-processing method that provides a novel perspective of group robustness.
Our work starts from the observation that there exists a clear trade-off between robust and average accuracies in existing works.
From this observation, we first proposed the robust scaling strategy, which captures the full trade-off landscape and identifies any desired performance point on the trade-off curve with no extra training.
Moreover, we proposed an instance-wise robust scaling algorithm that is effective to enhance the trade-off itself.
Based on these strategies, we introduced a novel convenient measure that summarizes the trade-off from a Pareto optimal perspective for a comprehensive evaluation of group robustness.
We believe that our approaches are helpful for analyzing the exact behavior of existing debiasing methods and paving the way in the future research direction.
