\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose a \textit{during-generation} text-to-3D watermarking method, \tool, which eliminates the delay between the generation phase and the watermarking phase: the watermark can be verified on the generated NeRF once the generation is finished. Inspired by the black-box model watermarking method, \tool watermarks NeRF by injecting backdoors into NeRF such that a secret message can be extracted from images rendered from arbitrary trigger viewport. Extensive experiments show that our method will not degrade generation quality and maintain robustness against image-level and model-level attacks.
